# sucide_rate_analysis
This project analyzes the global connection between suicide rates, per capita income, and unemployment across continents using real-world datasets and Python-driven insights. It examines how economic and social factors influence mental health outcomes through data cleaning, correlation analysis, and compelling visualizations. By uncovering patterns that link joblessness, income disparity, and well-being, the project aims to provide a data-informed perspective on the socioeconomic roots of mental distress. It serves as a valuable reference for analysts, researchers, and policymakers exploring the intersection of economics and human psychology.
