***Analysis Report: Suicide Rates, PCI, and Unemployment Across Continents (2000–2021)***

*Objective:*

To explore relationships between average suicide rates, per capita income (PCI), and unemployment rates across six world continents over recent decades.



*Data Sources:*

Global suicide rates by country and year (2000–2021)
Country-to-continent mapping



Continent-level PCI averages (authentic World Bank/IMF/OECD sources)



Continent-level unemployment rates (official statistics, 2022–2025)



*Key Results*
Suicide Rate and PCI:
Aggregated average PCI and suicide rates visualized by continent.
The Pearson correlation coefficient between PCI and suicide rate was 0.07, indicating almost no linear relationship at the continental scale.



Suicide Rate and Unemployment:
Average continent-level unemployment rates were merged and analyzed.
The correlation between suicide rate and unemployment was 0.44—a moderate positive relationship. Higher unemployment is associated with higher suicide rates at this aggregate level.



*Visualizations:*
Scatter-plots of suicide rate vs. PCI and suicide rate vs. unemployment for each continent.
Bar charts depicting PCI, suicide rate, and unemployment rate by continent.
All charts saved for reporting/presentation.



*Interpretation:*
While PCI does not appear to be strongly linked to suicide rates, unemployment shows a moderate association.
Economic and job conditions are measurable factors, but other variables (mental health access, culture, social support, and education) must be considered for a full understanding.
Continent-level analysis gives valuable broad insight, but more granular country-year studies can reveal stronger and more actionable relationships.



*Recommendations*
Policy: Programs to reduce unemployment and strengthen social safety nets may help mitigate suicide risk, especially in higher-risk regions.
Further Research: Investigate local and country-level data, consider time trends, and incorporate additional socioeconomic and health factors for comprehensive models.
Advanced Analysis: Consider multi-factor regression, including unemployment, PCI, education, and mental health indicators.
