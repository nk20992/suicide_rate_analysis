This analysis examined the relationship between suicide rates, per capita income (PCI), and unemployment rates across major continents from 2000 to 2021, utilizing reputable global datasets. The findings indicate that PCI and suicide rates are not significantly correlated, suggesting that regional economic wealth alone does not directly predict suicide risk. Conversely, a moderate positive correlation (0.44) was observed between unemployment rates and suicide rates, implying that regions with higher unemployment tend to experience higher suicide rates. These results emphasize the importance of addressing unemployment within suicide prevention strategies and highlight the need for comprehensive approaches that consider social, cultural, and healthcare-related factors. While economic indicators provide valuable policy insights, enhancing mental health services and social support systems remains essential for effective suicide prevention.
